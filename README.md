Problem Title : Mini Cloud File Storage System (Google Drive–like Basic Replica)

Problem Description :

With the increasing use of cloud platforms, file storage and sharing have become essential services in both academic and professional environments. However, beginners often use cloud services without understanding how such systems work internally.

This project aims to build a simplified cloud file storage system similar to Google Drive, where users can upload, download, view, and delete files securely through a web interface. The system will use cloud storage services to store files and a backend server to manage user authentication and file metadata.

The focus is on learning the core concepts behind cloud-based storage systems, including client–server architecture, cloud APIs, authentication, and data management.


Problem Objectives :

1. Understand basic cloud computing concepts and architectures

2. Learn how cloud storage services work

3. Implement user authentication and access control

4. Develop simple backend APIs for file handling

5. Gain hands-on experience with cloud deployment


Proposed Solution :

1. Web-based cloud file storage application

2. User login and authentication module

3. File upload, download, and delete functionality

4. Cloud-based storage integration

5. Deployed working system with documentation and demo
